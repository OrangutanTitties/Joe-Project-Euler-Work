#Euler Project Problem 1
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
#Brute force method of just checking every single number from 1 to 999 was use for the folowing function.
